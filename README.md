# Yet Another Scaffolding Project

The goal of this project is to create a *very* opinionated scaffolding for a fullstack web app. This is to reduce the time from an idea's conception to its MVP phase. It should handle low to low-medium scale and be easy to iterate on with potential to scale. 

**Ethos: Reduce time thinking about and setting up the tech you will use, to increase time thinking on what you're using it for, and building it.**
